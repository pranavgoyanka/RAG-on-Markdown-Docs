"""How to make a request to /tasks?"",","To make a request to /tasks, you can use the `requests` library in Python. Here's an example:

  ```python
  import requests

  # Define the URL and parameters for the request
  url = 'https://api.omniflow.com/tasks'
  params = {
    'project_id': 'your_project_id',
    'task_name': 'your_task_name',
    'assigned_to': 'your_assigned_user_id'
  }

  # Make the request and parse the response
  response = requests.post(url, params=params)
  response_json = response.json()
  print(response_json)
  ```
  
  This code will make a POST request to the `/tasks` endpoint with the `project_id`, `task_name`, and `assigned_to` parameters. The response will be parsed into a JSON object and printed to the console.","To make a request to /tasks, you can use the `GET` method and the URL `/tasks` in the `url` parameter. Here's an example:
  
  ```python
  from flask import request
  from flask_restful import Resource
  
  class Tasks(Resource):
      def get(self):
          tasks = []
          for task in get_tasks():
