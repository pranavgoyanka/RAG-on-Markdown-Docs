# [WIP] RAG on Markdown Documentation

This project is a prototype for building a RAG system, that can take in proprietary documentation in Markdown format, and use that to fine tune LLM responses.

## To Dos
- [ ] Build everything as a Web server that accepts documents from the User and allows working on them.
- [ ] Build a Web UI
  - [ ] Disable upload button once uploaded
- [ ] Implement vectorization and semantic search natively (for research purposes)
  - [ ] Eventually make the system dependency free
- [ ] Test the system with different LLMs / Provide users a choice of the model to use
